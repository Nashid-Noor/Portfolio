      "shortDescription": "Optimized multi-agent LLM orchestration system reducing latency by 65% while maintaining output quality.",
      "description": "Built an intelligent orchestration layer for multi-agent LLM systems that dynamically routes queries to optimal model combinations. The system uses learned routing policies to balance cost, latency, and quality trade-offs in real-time.",
      "problemStatement": "Multi-agent LLM systems suffer from high latency due to sequential model calls and inefficient routing. Existing approaches don't adapt to query complexity or available resources.",
      "solution": "Developed a learned router using a lightweight transformer that predicts optimal agent combinations based on query embeddings. Implemented speculative execution for parallel model calls and adaptive caching for common query patterns.",
      "impact": [
        "Reduced time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 65%",
        "Decreased end-to-end latency by 52%",
